This README file provides an overview of Task 8 within the project, which focuses on model deployment for predicting the unemployment rate in Kenya. In this task, we make the predictive model accessible to end-users and stakeholders through a deployment environment.


# Kenya Unemployment Rate Prediction App

This app predicts the Total Unemployment in Kenya based on provided features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10

### Installation

1. Create a Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda create -n env python=3.10
    ```

2. Activate the Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate env
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
